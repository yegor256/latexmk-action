# Latexmk Github Action

To `latexmk` your LaTeX document by GitHub Action just
create a `.github/workflows/latexmk.yml` file:

```yaml
name: latexmk
on:
  push:
jobs:
  latexmk:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: yegor256/latexmk-action@0.11.0
        with:
          cmd: latexmk
          path: foo
          opts: -pdf
          packages: acmart tikz
```

Preferrably, you should have `.latexmkrc` in the `foo` directory of your repository,
which configures the behavior of [latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html).
If you don't have special requirements in your project, and just need to compile
a `.tex` file, skip the config, everything should work out of the box.

The options available (provided via the `with` YAML element):

* `cmd` is the command to run (default is `latexmk`)
* `path` is a relative path of the directory with `.tex` file(s)
* `opts` is the options to pass to `latexmk`
* `packages` is a space-separated list of TeXLive package to install
  from [CTAN](https://ctan.org)
* `depends` is a file with TeXLive packages,
  as CTAN [expects](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/598653) them

## How to Contribute

In order to test this action, just run:

```bash
make test
```

This should build a new Docker image and then try to use it
in order to render a simple `test.tex` document. You need to have
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
